**Working Group: Code Coverage Tool for R**

Code coverage helps to ensure greater software quality by reporting how
thoroughly test suites cover the various code paths. Having a tool that
supports the breadth of the R language across multiple platforms, and
that is used by R package developers and R core teams, helps to improve
software quality for the R Community. While a few code coverage tools
exist for R, this Oracle-proposed ISC project aims to provide an
enhanced tool that addresses feature and platform limitations of
existing tools via an ISC-established working group. It also aims to
promote the use of code coverage more systematically within the R
ecosystem.

The Code Coverage group released a revised covr package over the summer
2017
(see https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2017/06/28/code-coverage-tool-for-r-working-group-achieves-first-release).
